Structure For frontend
‚Ä¢	login.html ‚Äì User login page
‚Ä¢	register.html ‚Äì User registration page
‚Ä¢	index.html ‚Äì Bookmark dashboard
‚Ä¢	script.js ‚Äì All frontend logic (API communication, rendering, etc.)
‚Ä¢	styles.css ‚Äì Basic styling for layout and UI

Instructions
1.	Open register.html in your browser to create a new user account.
2.	After registering, use login.html to authenticate.
3.	Once logged in, you will be redirected to index.html, where you can:
o	Add bookmarks
o	View and filter bookmarks by tag
o	View most visited bookmarks
o	Assign or remove tags from bookmarks
o	Edit or delete existing entries

Design Decisions
‚Ä¢	Backend: Flask (Python) + SQLAlchemy for ORM
‚Ä¢	Authentication: JWT-based stateless authentication
‚Ä¢	Frontend: Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS for minimal setup and fast loading
‚Ä¢	Database: SQLite by default, but easily extendable (e.g., PostgreSQL)
‚Ä¢	Security: CORS configured to allow frontend communication only from localhost:5173 (adjustable)
